What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually pwComments could be added to a page by TypoScript, only. This
extension is an attempt to make pwComments available as a plugin, to
add it as a normal content element.

Due to limitations in flexforms and missing time, it's actually not
possible to configure pwComments inside the content element.
